In this game, the player controls the snake and move it around using arrows.
As the snake finds food, it eats the food and thereby it grows larger making the
game increasingly difficult.
The game ends when the snake either moves off the screen or moves into itself.
The goal is to make the snake as large as possible before that happens and
score maximum points.
You can pause or play the game by clicking pause/play buttons or by
pressing space and enter keys respectively.
